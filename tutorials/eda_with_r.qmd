title: "Exploring data with R"
---

In this tutorial we will look deeper at the R programming language and how it can be used for <mark>exploratory data analysis</mark> (EDA).

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should:

* Recognise the building blocks of the R environment: <mark>objects</mark>, <mark>values</mark>, and <mark>functions</mark>.
* Use the R console to load a dataset, calculate a statistic and produce a plot
* Begin your *Zettelk√§sten* with notes on the key pieces of R syntax you have learned

## Prerequisites

* Andy Matuschak, '[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)'
* [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) on your computer

## Foundation

## A note on typography
R code, including literal values and the names of objects and functions, is denoted by `code-style text`.
The names of R packages are [linked](#) the first time they are mentioned, but otherwise written with normal text.
Specialist statistical and programming concepts and other 'terms of art' are <mark>highlighted</mark>.
