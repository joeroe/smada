title: "Visualising distributions"
---

This tutorial is the first of two covering visualisations as a tool for exploratory data analysis. 
It introduces the package `ggplot2`, which provides a flexible *grammar of graphics* for visualising data in R.

This tutorial focuses on visualising the *distribution* of data â€“ almost always the first step when you are getting to grasps with a new dataset.
